         Polynomial  and   Rational  Filtered  Lanczos   and  subspace
         iteration algorithms For Symmetric Eigenvalue problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to EVSL. EVSL is a C library for computing the eigenvalues of
a symmetric matrix  that are located in a given  interval.  This first
release includes the routines listed above and does not yet offer full
parallel implementations  (trivial openMP test programs  are available
in among  the test  drivers).  EVSL also  provides tools  for spectrum
slicing, i.e.,  the technique of  subdividing a given interval  into p
smaller subintervals and computing the eigenvalues in each subinterval
independently.  EVSL  implements a polynomial filtered  Lanczos (thick
restart, no  restart) a rational  filtered Lanczos (thick  restart, no
restart), and a polynomial filtered subspace iteration.

  INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Library:
     The users only need to modify the file makefile.in 
     [see makefile.in.example for samples of files makefile.in 
     that are given for mac-os and for Linux].
      
     1. cp makefile.in_Linux/MacOS.example makefile.in. 
     2. modify makefile.in 
        [provide BLAS/LAPACK path, and optionally SuiteSparse path]
     3. make clean; make

     make in the directory SRC will create the library liblancheb.a

  RATIONAL                                                   FILTERING
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rational  filtering  requires  solving  linear  systems  (where  the
  coefficient matrix  is the  original matrix  shifted by  a *complex*
  shift).  A linear solver routine  must be provided.  By default EVSL
  uses UMFPACK, a sparse direct  solver package by T. Davis.  (version
  4.5.3 has been tested)

    by Timothy Davis.  Please refer to that package for its License.

  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

  After  having  computed  the  rational  filter  by  "find_ratf(intv,
  &rat)", users  can call "set_ratf_solfunc(&rat, &Acsr,  NULL, NULL)"
  to tell  EVSL to use UMFPACK  to factorize the shifted  matrices and
  solve the linear systems. The factors will be saved in struct rat.

  EVSL  can  also  take  user-specified  solvers.  To  do  this,  call
  "set_ratf_solfunc(&rat,  &Acsr,  func,  data)" to  pass  the  solver
  functions and the associated data for each pole.  "func" is an array
  of function  pointers of  length num of  poles, i.e.,  rat->num. So,
  func[i]  is the  function  to solve  the systems  with  pole i,  the
  coefficient matrix of  which is $A - s_i I$,  where s_i = rat->zk[i]
  is the  complex shift.  "data"  is an array  of (void*) of  the same
  length,  where data[i]  is the  data needed  by func[i].   

  All "func" must be of the following prototype

      void linsolFunc(int n, double *br, double *bz, double *xr, 
                      double *xz, void *data);

  where n  is the size  of the system,  br, bz are  the right-hand
  side (real and  imaginary parts of complex vector),  xr, xz will
  be the  solution (complex vector),  and "data" contains  all the
  data  needed  for  the  solver.    

  Once "set_ratf_solfunc" is done, rational filtering Lanczos methods 
  should be ready to use.
      
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  LINKING  WITH  UMFPACK (SuiteSparse        4.5.3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The  makefiles   in  TESTS_Lap   and  TEST_Gen,  include   paths  to
  SuiteSparse 4.5.3.   UMFPACK requires AMD, CHOLMOD,  COLAMD, CCOLAMD
  and  CAMD,  and  optionally  METIS 5.1.0.   Compile  each  of  these
  packages  to  have  the  library  file in  the  Lib  directory.   If
  SuiteSparse  is configured  with METIS,  give the  path to  METIS (v
  5.1.0)  as  well   (to  make  libmetis.a,  type   `make  config'  in
  metis-5.1.0/ and then `make') Please  refer to SuiteSparse and METIS
  for installation details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  MATRIX-FREE SOLVERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  All  the  iterative solvers  in  EVSL  can  be used  in  matrix-free
  ways. Users need only to  provide the matrix-vector product function
  of the following prototype:
  
      void Matvec(double *x, double *y, void *data);

  where y  = A *  x and data  is the pointer  to the associated  data to
  perform the  matvec. The  (void *)  argument is  to provide  a uniform
  interface  to all  user-specific  functions. For  a particular  Matvec
  function, one can pack all data  needed by this function into a struct
  and pass the  pointer of this struct  to EVSL (after cast  it to (void
  *)). This  function needs to  be passed to EVSL  as well, so  EVSL can
  call  this  function  to  perform  all matvecs.  Note  that  when  the
  user-input  matvec  function  is  set,  the CSR  matrix  will  not  be
  referenced even if it  is provided (so it is safe to give NULL for the
  matrix input in this case).

  In  TEST_LAP,  an example  of  matvec  functions for  2D/3D  Laplacian
  matrices is  provided, where the  matrix is not explicitly  formed but
  5pt/7pt stencil is used instead. In  this example, a struct for matvec
  is first defined:

  typedef struct _lapmv_t {  
    int  nx,  ny,  nz; 
    double  *stencil;  
  } lapmv_t;

  and the matvec function is implemented

  void Lap2D3DMatvec(double  *x, double  *y,  void  *data) {  
    lapmv_t *lapmv = (lapmv_t *) data; 
    int nx = lapmv->nx; 
    int ny = lapmv->ny;
    int nz = lapmv->nz; 
    double *stencil = lapmv->stencil; 
    ...  
  }

  in  which   the  pointer  is  first   casted  and  all  the   data  is
  unpacked. Once these are ready, they can be passed to EVSL by calling
    
  SetMatvecFunc(n, &Lap2D3DMatvec, (void*) &lapmv);

  where the first input is the size of the "matrix", the second input is
  the  function pointer  and the  third one  is the  data pointer.  Once
  "SetMatvecFunc"  is  called,  EVSL  will  use  the  registered  matvec
  function to perform all matvecs.

  Users should first create a function  wrapper of the above type for an
  external matvec routine. Then, following  the steps in the example, it
  will be straightforward to use it in EVSL.
