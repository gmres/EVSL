This directory  contains drivers for testing  a few routines
for computing eigenvalues of general sparse (symmetric real)
matrices. These matrices are read  from a file in the matrix
market format.  note: HB matrix format is not supported.

For  the rational  filter driver  you will  need to  link to
various modules  from the  SuiteSparse package. This  is not
provided but  the makefile  will indicate which  modules are
used.

For better clarity  we have separated the  makefiles in two:
makefileP   (to  make   the   drivers  invoking   Polynomial
filtering)  and  makefileR  (to make  the  drivers  invoking
Rational filtering).

GenPLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make -f makefileP GenPLanR.ex--> executable GenPLanR.ex

GenPLanN.c :  
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter non-restarting Lanczos
    make -f makefileP GenPLanN.ex--> executable GenPLanN.ex

GenPSI.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Polynomial Filter Subspace Iteration
    make -f makefileP GenPSI.ex--> executable GenPSI.ex

GenPLanR_omp.c : 
    same as GenPLanR_omp.c but with openMP
    parallelization across slices
    make -f makefileP GenPLanR_omp.ex--> executable GenPLanR_omp.ex

GenRLanR.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter Lanczos with thick Restart
    make -f makefileR GenRLanR.ex--> executable GenRLanR.ex

GenRLanN.c : 
    driver for testing spectrum slicing -- with 
    Rational Filter non-restarting Lanczos 
    make -f makefileR GenRLanN.ex--> executable GenRLanN.ex

io.c    : functions - in particular for reading matrices in mm format
mmio.c  : support functions for mm format [not all are needed] 

The computed eigenvalues are saved in OUT/ folder. 
 
Run:

./Gen*.ex
